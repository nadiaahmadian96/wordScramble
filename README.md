In this app you’ll work with two of the real fundamentals of app development: List for working with tables of data, and strings, for handling text including how to work with their Unicode representation so we can get compatibility with older Objective-C frameworks.

Unicode is a standard for storing and representing text, which at first glance you might think sounds easy. But trust me on this: it really isn’t. You know how I said dates are hard? Well, dates are easy compared to storing text properly. In fact, there’s even a joke mug you can buy that says “I ? Unicode” – a painful reminder that when text representation goes bad all you see is a question mark where the symbol should be.
